This is a simple mod that adds pink petal "fairy rings" to the world. In real life, fairy rings are made of mushrooms, but I think flowers are much prettier. They also make for nicer looking circles in Minecraft.

Fairy rings are relatively frequent and may show up in plains and meadows. It is believed that disrupting a fairy ring causes bad luck, and is associated with demons, devils, and witches.
